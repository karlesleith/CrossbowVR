## Introduction 
In "Storm The Door", you are a lone infantry tasked to protect the village from a hoard of mischievous Goblins

### How To Play
This game is compatable with Android devices and intended to be played with a VR Viewer (Such as Google Cardboard).

When the title screen loads, simply look at the "Play" button to start the game.
<br/>
When the game beings you find yourself on the Castle Walls, you are able to Teleport between towers by looking at the "Green Arrow" to fire at the pesky Goblin, just look at them!

The Goal is to compete for the HighScore, So make sure you take out as many Goblins as you can before they destroy the gate, but don't worry, once you complete a round you get a nifty bonus to the Gates Health




## Development
During the process of development we learned how to use the Android SDK Google Cardboard VR packages for Unity.
